# The front end is plain CSS + native ES modules (no Node.js/npm/bundler), so
# there is nothing to build for the UI — the assets in cmd/dcrdata/public are
# served as-is. We just build the Go binary and copy it alongside the templates
# (views_v2/) and static assets (public/), which dcrdata serves relative to its
# working directory.
